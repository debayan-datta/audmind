## Overview

**AudMind** addresses the gap in multimodal reasoning for mental health by offering a curated dataset and tools for evaluating audio-language models. The project is designed to help researchers and practitioners explore how audio cues and language can be jointly leveraged to better understand and reason about mental health conditions.

---

## Key Features

- **Domain-Specific Dataset:** The first dataset tailored for audio-grounded reasoning in mental health.
- **Multimodal Integration:** Enables research on models that combine audio and language for richer understanding.
- **Baselines & Evaluation:** Includes scripts and benchmarks for model evaluation.
- **Modular Codebase:** Each subfolder contains focused resources and documentation for easy navigation and extension.
